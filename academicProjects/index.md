<img align="right" width="341" height="400" src="../../pics/RobustICA.jpg">{:style="margin-left: 10px;"}
This project was completed through the REU program at University of Washington, Bothell. I worked under Dr. Hung Cao and Dr. Tadesse Ghirmai to develop an algorithm that could take abdominal ECG (aECG) data from a pregnant mother, extract out the separate fetal ECG (fECG) and maternal ECG (mECG) signals, while simultaneously removing any motion artifacts present in the signal. This algorithm utilizes Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and an analysis was done comparing results from using FastICA vs. RobustICA.
