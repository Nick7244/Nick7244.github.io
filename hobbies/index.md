**Hyas Lake, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest**

While spending the summer of 2018 out in Seattle, Washington, I took a weekend backpacking trip with my cousin to Hyas Lake, located within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in the Cascade mountain range. We spent the night down on Hyas Lake, and took a day hike the following morning up to Tuck Lake, yielding a great view of Mt. Daniel. The trail was 2 miles in to the Hyas Lake base camp, with an additional 3.8 miles and 1730' of elevation gain up to Tuck Lake. At its steepest, the trail gains ~700' elevation in just under 0.7 miles (that's a nearly 19% grade, phew!).

**Columbia River Gorge**

During the same summer I was in Seattle, I took a weekend trip to Portland with my father. While there, we went for a driving tour through the Columbia River Gorge, which divides Washington and Oregon. There are a variety of easy to moderate hikes along either side of the gorge offering some beautiful views of the river.

**Acadia National Park**

Perhaps my favorite place to visit and go hiking is Acadia National Park. Located on Mt. Desert Island just off the coast of Maine, Acadia National Park is home to some fantastic hikes and some great ocean views. It is also home to one of only a small handful of sandy beaches in Maine! My favorite hike at Acadia is the Beehive Trail. It is only about 2 miles round trip, but don't let that fool you, its a toughy! The latter half of the trail is filled with VERY narrow segments along precarious cliff edges, and large, vertical boulders that you can only scale by climbing the set of iron rungs hammered into the cliff face. It is certainly unlike any other trail I've come across, and is perhaps one of the most rewarding and enjoyable! The first time you ascend will probably be a bit scary, but I promise, the views are worth the climb!

**Maiden Cliff**

Another fantastic, but perhaps lesser known, Maine hiking trail is the Maiden Cliff Trail. This is a trail I've been hiking since I was young, and has become a perennial staple for my family. Its only 1.7 miles round trip, but it provides some spectacular views, making it a great midday, pack-a-lunch type of hike.
