- Led the development of a full-stack C++ re-architecture of motion control modules for the ExcelsiusGPS, including a full-scale overhaul of surgical navigation and accuracy calculations during automated robotic motion
- Utilized C++ to re-architect TCP communication between the ExcelsiusGPS surgery robot and embedded GMAS motion controller, ensuring continuous and reliable 40Hz communication of odometry and tracking information
- Optimized the kinematic calibration algorithm, in C++, for the Excelsius3D robotic imaging system, enabling 200% more accurate patient registration for navigated surgical CT scans and Fluoroscopy shots

- Designed a 1 kHz robotic simulation system to mimic the motion control of the ExcelsiusGPS spinal surgery robot
- Developed a 3D robotics model of the ExcelsiusGPS robot using the Webots simulation environment
- Implemented kinematic motion control code and simulated hardware interfaces, in C++, to accurately simulate the movement and telemetry information of the physical robot
- Re-architected a variety of motion control libraries with CMake configuration to ensure seamless linkages to
both the physical and simulated robot
- This simulation is now being utilized at two sites worldwide to more effectively develop new control behaviors 
for the physical robot

<img align="right" width="275" height="128" src="../pics/Industry/neocis.jpg">

- Designed and developed control software algorithms for implementation in the Yomi dental surgery robot
- Worked collaboratively with both hardware and software engineers to improve haptics control algorithms
- Developed a haptics algorithm to discriminate between active surgeon manipulation and an idle robot
  - Increased the accuracy of successfully detecting active surgeon manipulation by ~3000%
  - Greatly decreased the risk of movement drift when system is idle, minimizing patient risk during surgery
