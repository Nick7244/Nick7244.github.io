- Designed a 1 kHz robotic simulation system to mimic the motion control of the ExcelsiusGPS spinal surgery robot
- Developed a 3D robotics model of the ExcelsiusGPS robot using the Webots simulation environment
- Implemented kinematics & motion control code that accurately simulates the movement of the physical robot
- Re-architected a variety of motion control libraries with CMake configuration to ensure seamless linkages to
both the physical and simulated robot
- This simulation is now being utilized at two sites worldwide to more effectively develop new control behaviors 
for the physical robot

- Designed and developed control software algorithms for implementation in the Yomi dental surgery robot
- Worked collaboratively with both hardware and software engineers to improve haptics control algorithms
- Developed a haptics algorithm to discriminate between active surgeon manipulation and an idle robot
  - Increased the accuracy of successfully detecting active surgeon manipulation by over 3000%
  - Greatly decreased the risk of movement drift when system is idle, minimizing patient risk during surgery
